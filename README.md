## Installation

> **Requires Node.js 22.12 or newer.** Node 18 and 20 have both reached
> end-of-life, and several of this package's dependencies no longer support
> them. Check yours with `node --version`.

### Run via npx (No Installation Required)

Once published to npm, you can run the server directly without cloning or building anything — `npx` downloads the prebuilt package and runs it:

```bash
npx -y imap-mcp-server
```

This is the easiest way to use the server in an MCP client (see [Configuration](#configuration) for ready-to-paste `npx` configs).

### Quick Install (Recommended)

#### macOS/Linux:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikolausm/imap-mcp-server/main/install.sh | bash
```

#### Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikolausm/imap-mcp-server/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikolausm/imap-mcp-server.git
cd imap-mcp-server
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Account Setup

Accounts are stored encrypted in `~/.imap-mcp/accounts.json`. This file is **shared by all run modes** — whether you start the server via `npx`, a global install, or a local clone, they all read the same accounts. So you only need to set up your accounts once.

### Setting Up Accounts in npx Mode

If you run the server via `npx` (no clone), you have two ways to add accounts:

**Option A — Run the setup wizard directly via npx (no install needed):**

```bash
npx -p imap-mcp-server imap-setup
```

This launches the same web-based wizard described below and writes to `~/.imap-mcp/accounts.json`, which your `npx`-configured MCP server then picks up automatically.

**Option B — Add accounts straight from your AI client:**

Once the MCP server is configured, just ask your assistant to add an account — it uses the `imap_add_account` tool. For example:

> "Add my IMAP account: host imap.gmail.com, port 993, user me@gmail.com, password …"

No separate setup step required.

### Web-Based Setup Wizard (Recommended)

After installation, run the setup wizard:

```bash
npm run setup
```

Or if installed globally:

```bash
imap-setup
```

Or directly via npx without installing:

```bash
npx -p imap-mcp-server imap-setup
```

This will:
1. Start a local web server
2. Open your browser to the setup wizard
3. Guide you through adding email accounts with pre-configured settings

The wizard listens on `127.0.0.1` only, so nothing else on your network can
reach it.

#### Running the wizard on another machine (server, NAS, VM)

**Recommended: SSH tunnel.** The wizard stays on loopback, and the connection is
encrypted:

```bash
ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 my-server      # then, on the server:
imap-setup --no-open
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your local browser.

**Alternative: bind to the network.** Pass `--host` (or set `IMAP_MCP_BIND`):

```bash
imap-setup --host 0.0.0.0 --no-open
```

The wizard then requires an access token and prints a URL containing it, e.g.
`http://my-server:3000/?token=…`. Open that URL; the token is exchanged for a
session cookie and removed from the address bar. Requests without the token are
refused, and so are cross-origin requests. Scripts can send
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` instead. To use a fixed token rather than a
random one per start, set `IMAP_MCP_WIZARD_TOKEN` (at least 16 characters); it is then not printed.

The connection is plain HTTP, so anyone who can read your network traffic can
see the token and the passwords you enter. Use this only on networks you trust,
and prefer the SSH tunnel otherwise.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `IMAP_MCP_BIND` | `127.0.0.1` | Address the wizard binds to (`--host` takes precedence) |
| `IMAP_MCP_WIZARD_TOKEN` | random per start | Access token when bound beyond loopback |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Port for `npm run web` (`imap-setup` uses `--port`) |

### Overriding Credentials via Environment Variables

You can override the username and password of an already-configured account at
runtime with environment variables — useful when you inject secrets from a
password manager or CI system instead of storing them in `accounts.json`.

The variables are keyed by the account **name**, uppercased with every
non-alphanumeric character replaced by `_`. For an account named `Work Gmail`
(key `WORK_GMAIL`):

| Variable | Overrides |
| --- | --- |
| `IMAP_MCP_ACCOUNT_WORK_GMAIL_IMAP_USERNAME` | IMAP username (`user`) |
| `IMAP_MCP_ACCOUNT_WORK_GMAIL_IMAP_PASSWORD` | IMAP password |
| `IMAP_MCP_ACCOUNT_WORK_GMAIL_SMTP_USERNAME` | SMTP username (`smtp.user`) |
| `IMAP_MCP_ACCOUNT_WORK_GMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD` | SMTP password |

Notes:
- Overrides apply **only to existing accounts**; if no account's normalized name
  matches, the variable is ignored.
- They are applied **in memory only** — nothing is written back to
  `accounts.json`, and the values are used as-is (not re-encrypted).
- Variables are **consumed at startup**: on server start they are captured into
  an AES-256-encrypted in-memory cache and removed from `process.env`, so the
  plaintext secret does not linger in the environment (where it could leak to
  child processes or diagnostics). Set them before launching the server.

The setup wizard integrates with this: each credential field (IMAP password,
IMAP username, SMTP username, SMTP password) has a **"Do not save to config; set
later using an environment variable"** checkbox. When ticked, the value you enter
is still used to test the connection, but it is not written to `accounts.json` —
the wizard shows the exact variable name to export, and the account picks the
credential up from that variable at runtime.
- SMTP variables take effect only when the account already has an SMTP config.
- Each variable takes effect independently; set only the ones you need.

**If the variable is missing**, the account still holds the empty placeholder the
wizard wrote. Rather than dialing out with a blank credential — which providers
answer with a generic authentication failure that looks exactly like a wrong
password — the server refuses the connection and names what to set:

```
Account "Work Gmail" has IMAP credentials marked as environment-managed, but
this variable was not set when the server started:
IMAP_MCP_ACCOUNT_WORK_GMAIL_IMAP_PASSWORD. Set it and restart the server, or
store the credentials on the account via imap_update_account.
```

Because the variables are read once at startup, setting one in an already-running
shell has no effect until the server is restarted.

### Supported Email Providers

The setup wizard includes pre-configured settings for:
- Gmail / Google Workspace
- Microsoft Outlook / Hotmail / Live
- Yahoo Mail
- Apple iCloud Mail
- GMX
- WEB.DE
- IONOS (1&1)
- ProtonMail (with Bridge)
- Fastmail
- Zoho Mail
- AOL Mail
- mailbox.org
- Posteo
- Custom IMAP servers

## Configuration

### Claude Code (CLI)

#### Option A — via npx (no clone/build needed)

```bash
claude mcp add imap -- npx -y imap-mcp-server
```

This always runs the latest published version and requires no local build.

#### Option B — from a local clone

If you use [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) in the terminal, add the MCP server with a single command:

**Step 1:** Make sure you have built the project first (see [Manual Installation](#manual-installation)).

**Step 2:** Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add imap -- node /absolute/path/to/imap-mcp-server/dist/index.js
```

> **Important:** Replace `/absolute/path/to/imap-mcp-server` with the actual path where you cloned the repository. For example:
> ```bash
> # macOS/Linux example:
> claude mcp add imap -- node /Users/yourname/imap-mcp-server/dist/index.js
>
> # Windows example:
> claude mcp add imap -- node C:\Users\yourname\imap-mcp-server\dist\index.js
> ```

**Step 3:** Verify it was added:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

You should see `imap` in the list of configured MCP servers. That's it — the IMAP tools are now available in your Claude Code sessions.

> **Tip:** If you want to remove the server later, run:
> ```bash
> claude mcp remove imap
> ```

### Claude Desktop (GUI App)

Add the IMAP MCP server to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Option A — via npx (recommended, no clone/build needed):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imap": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "imap-mcp-server"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

**Option B — from a local clone:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imap": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/imap-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Restricting tool access (read-only mode / allowlist)

By default all tools are exposed. You can restrict which tools the agent sees
using two environment variables (set them under the `env` key of your MCP
config). This is useful when you want to give an assistant **read-only** access
to a mailbox, or expose only a hand-picked subset of tools.

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `IMAP_MCP_READ_ONLY` | When truthy (`1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`), only the safe, read-only tools are registered — searching, reading, listing folders, unread counts, spam analysis. No tool that sends mail, deletes/moves messages, changes flags, or edits accounts is exposed. |
| `IMAP_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS` | Comma-separated allowlist of tool names — only these are registered. Names are case-insensitive and the `imap_` prefix is optional (`search_emails` ≡ `imap_search_emails`). When set, it takes precedence over `IMAP_MCP_READ_ONLY`. |

**Example — read-only access:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imap": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "imap-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "IMAP_MCP_READ_ONLY": "true" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example — explicit allowlist:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imap": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "imap-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "IMAP_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS": "imap_search_emails,imap_get_email,imap_get_latest_emails" }
    }
  }
}
```

The read-only subset is: `imap_list_accounts`, `imap_connect`, `imap_disconnect`,
`imap_test_account`, `imap_search_emails`, `imap_get_email`,
`imap_get_latest_emails`, `imap_download_attachment`, `imap_find_thread_messages`,
`imap_find_email_by_message_id`, `imap_list_folders`, `imap_folder_status`,
`imap_get_unread_count`, `imap_check_spam`, `imap_domain_stats`,
`imap_list_spam_domains`.

## Usage

Once configured, the IMAP MCP server provides the following tools in Claude:

> **Choosing an account.** For the email and folder tools, `accountId` is
> **optional** and backward-compatible. You may instead pass `accountName`, and
> if you only have a **single** account configured you can omit both — that
> account is used by default. With multiple accounts and no selector, the tool
> returns a clear error listing your options (`imap_list_accounts`).

### Account Management

- **imap_add_account**: Add a new IMAP account
  ```
  Parameters:
  - name: Friendly name for the account
  - host: IMAP server hostname
  - port: Server port (default: 993)
  - user: Username
  - password: Password
  - tls: Use TLS/SSL (default: true)
  - allowStartTLS: When tls is false, set to false to also disable the
      opportunistic STARTTLS upgrade imapflow otherwise attempts whenever the
      server advertises it (validating the cert against `host` regardless of
      `tls`). Needed for providers that advertise STARTTLS on a hostname
      covered only by a shared/wildcard cert. Defaults to true.
  - sentFolder: Explicit Sent-folder name for sent-mail copies, e.g. "Gesendet"
      (optional — only needed when the server has no \Sent SPECIAL-USE folder
      and auto-detection fails)
  - defaultBcc: Optional BCC address(es) applied automatically to every
      outbound send, reply, forward, and draft for this account. Merged with
      any per-call `bcc` (duplicates removed case-insensitively)
  - allowedFrom: Optional list of additional sender identities permitted in
      outbound `From` headers. The account email and login are always allowed
  ```

- **imap_update_account**: Update an existing account (fix SMTP settings, rename, etc.)
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: ID of the account to update
  - name, host, port, user, password, tls, allowStartTLS, email: IMAP fields (all optional)
  - smtpHost, smtpPort, smtpSecure, smtpUser, smtpPassword: SMTP fields (optional)
  - saveToSent: Save sent emails to the Sent folder (optional)
  - sentFolder: Explicit Sent-folder override (optional). Pass an empty string
      to clear the override and re-enable auto-detection
  - defaultBcc: Optional default BCC address(es) (optional). Pass an empty
      string to clear
  - allowedFrom: Optional list of additional sender identities. Pass an empty
      array to clear
  ```

`allowedFrom` is an application-level guardrail, not a hard security boundary:
an agent with access to `imap_update_account` can change the allowed identities.
The SMTP server must enforce the actual sender authorization policy. Sender
mailbox addresses are matched case-insensitively; the supplied display name and
address casing are preserved in the outbound `From` header. This applies to
sending, drafts, replies, and forwards.

- **imap_list_accounts**: List all configured accounts

- **imap_remove_account**: Remove an account
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: ID of the account to remove
  ```

- **imap_connect**: Connect to an account
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId OR accountName: Account identifier
  ```

- **imap_disconnect**: Disconnect from an account
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account to disconnect
  ```

### Email Operations

- **imap_search_emails**: Search for emails
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name (default: INBOX; ignored when searchAllFolders is true)
  - searchAllFolders: Search across ALL folders at once (default: false).
      Skips Trash/Spam/Drafts and non-selectable folders by default. Use when a
      message may have been filed/moved/archived and you don't know its folder.
  - includeTrash, includeSpam, includeDrafts: Opt those noisy folders back into
      a searchAllFolders run (default: false each)
  - from, to, subject, body: Search criteria
  - since, before: Date filters
  - seen, flagged: Status filters
  - keywords: Match messages with ANY of these custom keywords (server-side OR).
      Read a mailbox's available custom keywords from `imap_folder_status`'s
      `customKeywords` field first.
  - unKeywords: Exclude messages with ANY of these custom keywords (result has
      NONE of them). Same keyword source as `keywords`.
  - limit: Max results (default: 50)
  - includeBody: Include parsed message body in the response (default: false).
      Fetches the RFC822 source once and parses it with mailparser, so you get
      uid + body in a single tool call instead of paying the N+1 cost of one
      `imap_get_email` per match. Body is rendered per `bodyFormat` and capped
      at `bodyMaxLength` per field.
  - bodyFormat: How to render the body when `includeBody` is true — `markdown`
      (default, clean Markdown via Turndown), `text`, `html`, or `auto`.
  - bodyMaxLength: Per-field cap when `includeBody` is true (default: 10000).
  ```
  > With `searchAllFolders`, results include a `folder` field per message plus
  > `foldersSearched`, and any folder that failed to open is reported in
  > `foldersErrored` (so a 0-result answer is never silently incomplete).
  >
  > `includeBody` is honored in the single-folder path only. For a
  > cross-folder sweep the lightweight header shape is preserved by design —
  > pulling RFC822 source for every match across many folders would multiply
  > bandwidth and parse cost. Follow up with `imap_get_email` for the specific
  > uids whose bodies you need.
  >
  > On some servers a "flagged"/starred message carries a custom keyword (e.g.
  > an Open-Xchange color label or Apple's `$MailFlagBit*`) instead of, or in
  > addition to, the `\Flagged` system flag — after any flagged search, check
  > each result's `customKeywords` field before concluding a message is or
  > isn't flagged.

- **imap_get_email**: Get full email content
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name
  - uid: Email UID
  - maxContentLength: Max characters for text/html body (default: 10000)
  - includeAttachmentText: Include text attachment previews (default: true)
  - maxAttachmentTextChars: Max characters per text attachment (default: 100000)
  ```

- **imap_get_latest_emails**: Get recent emails
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name (default: INBOX)
  - count: Number of emails (default: 10)
  - includeBody: Include parsed message body (default: false). Same semantics
      as the `includeBody` option on `imap_search_emails` — one round-trip
      instead of N×`imap_get_email`.
  - bodyFormat: `markdown` (default), `text`, `html`, or `auto`.
  - bodyMaxLength: Per-field cap (default: 10000).
  ```

- **imap_mark_as_read/unread**: Change email read status
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name
  - uid: Email UID, OR an array of UIDs to flag in one call. Batch uses a
      single IMAP STORE so the operation is atomic at the server level — all
      UIDs are flagged, or none. Useful when triaging many messages at once.
  ```

- **imap_flag_email/unflag_email**: Star/unstar an email (sets or clears the IMAP \Flagged system flag — shows as a "star" in Gmail and Apple Mail). Some servers/clients (Open-Xchange, Apple Mail) also set a separate custom keyword (e.g. `$cl_N`, `$MailFlagBit*`) when flagging; unflag only clears `\Flagged`, so if a message still shows as flagged, check `customKeywords` via `imap_get_email` and clear it with `imap_remove_keyword`.
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
  - folder: Folder name
  - uid: Email UID
  ```

- **imap_add_keyword/remove_keyword**: Set or clear an arbitrary *custom* (non-system) IMAP keyword/label on an email, passed through verbatim (e.g. provider color labels like Open-Xchange's `$cl_1`..`$cl_10` or Apple Mail's `$MailFlagBit0`..`$MailFlagBit2`, or any other custom keyword). Backslash-prefixed system flags (e.g. `\Flagged`, `\Seen`, `\Deleted`) are rejected — use the dedicated flag/read tools for those. Not every server permits custom-keyword changes (see the mailbox's PERMANENTFLAGS); if the server rejects or silently ignores the change, the call fails instead of reporting success.
  ```
  Parameters:
  - accountId: Account ID
